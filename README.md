Data deposition for the article : [DOI]

This repository stores the code developed for mowing frequency detection and the reference data used for calibration and validation. 
The code can be copy and pasted in the Google Earth Engine Code Editor and executed. We provide the code for pixel resolution mowing frequency assessment, parcel resolution mowing frequency assessment, mowing frequency maps export.
The reference data is composed by one shapefile in which all the parcels are stored, with specification of site of belonging and training/validation splitting, and by four rasters (.tiff) which are used in pixel resolution accuracy assessment. Both shapefile and rasters can be uploaded as new assets in Google Earth Engine.
