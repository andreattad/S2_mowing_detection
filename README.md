This repository stores the code developed for mowing frequency detection and the reference data used for calibration and validation. 
The code can be run in Google Earth Engine. We provide the code for pixel resolution mowing frequency assessment, parcel resolution mowing frequency assessment, mowing frequency maps export.
The reference data is composed of one shapefile in which all the parcels are stored, with specification of site of belonging, and by four rasters (.tiff) which are used in pixel resolution accuracy assessment.
